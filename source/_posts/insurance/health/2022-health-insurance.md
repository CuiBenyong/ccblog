## Health Insurance Frequently Asked Questions

### Are health insurance premiums tax deductible?

Health insurance premiums are deductible only if total medical expenses exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI) in a year.

If taxpayers want to deduct health-related expenses, they must also itemize their deductions.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 significantly increased the standard deduction, so itemizing won't make much sense for most taxpayers.

Self-employed individuals who do not qualify for employer-sponsored health insurance may be able to deduct their premiums for tax purposes without itemizing.

### What does health insurance cover?

Health insurance usually covers the cost of medical, prescription and surgical services. It pays for your care if you get sick or injured, as well as preventive care, such as vaccines and wellness visits with your doctor. It pays for most prescription drugs and medical equipment.

However, health insurance does not cover elective surgery or cosmetic treatments, unlike accident insurance. If you have an accident, health insurance will likely pay for your medical expenses, but accident insurance is a supplemental policy that provides you with a one-time fee to help cover the cost of out-of-pocket expenses related to your accident.

### Does health insurance cover treatment?

Health insurance may cover therapy and counseling visits, but it depends on the specific policy. Check your insurance summary to see if mental health counseling is covered.

If it is covered, make sure the provider accepts your specific plan. Many therapists do not accept health insurance. If this is the case, you can submit receipts to your health insurance provider for reimbursement. They may offer some benefits for out-of-network therapists, but again, this varies by policy.

### Does health insurance cover dentistry?

Medical insurance plans do not cover dental expenses, except for children.Adult dental coverage must be purchased separately. If you get health insurance through your employer, they may also offer dental coverage.

### How do I find out what my health insurance covers? 

Insurance companies must provide a document listing all covered services. Most people receive a copy when they first enroll. If you can't find yours, log into your insurance profile online or call a customer service representative for a summary.

### How much does health insurance cost? 

The cost of a health insurance plan can vary greatly depending on factors such as your health status, your geographic area, your deductible amount and co-payment requirements. It's a good idea to compare the total costs and benefits of a plan rather than just looking at the premiums.

Policies with lower deductibles usually allow you to pay less upfront, but you will pay higher monthly premiums in exchange for this. When you need care, you are actually paying more each month instead of paying a lump sum through your deductible. You may also have to pay a co-payment, which is a fixed percentage of the remaining balance after you pay your deductible. You and your insurance company share the cost.

The health insurance you may get through your employer is often cheaper than buying a policy on your own.

### Is health insurance worth it? 

It's hard to find a situation where health insurance isn't worth the cost. You never know when you might get sick or injured, and paying for health insurance is much cheaper than paying for big medical bills. Doctor's visits, hospitalizations and ambulance rides can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Paying for health insurance is better than risking getting stuck with those bills.
